# Dynamic Models for Building Energy Management

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cghiaus/dm4bem/HEAD)

The project models a simple 2-rooms inside a building for a thermal dynamic simulation. A thermal circuit of the space, simplified by assumptions, is represented by state-space matrices and run in a jupyter notebook environment. A dynamic simulation with weather data is implemented to validate our model. 

The main_code contains the entire project including code and results. The weather_data folder contains the weather files with extension .epw,  for the airport Lyon-Bron, France (N45.73, E5.08).
